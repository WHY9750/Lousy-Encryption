# Simple_Encryption

This program takes ASCII characters and convert to their ASCII index and then make some multiplication, division and summation and then do a couple a swaps in the index location and then eventually give us a very gibberish text. I written this code in a day without any background or any referencing to anyone and I most certainly have no idea what is cryptography at the time of writing this code. That is why it is a very lousy encryption (I dont't know, I'm not an expert to judge :p, oh well if you are a crpytographer, please let me know how long it take you to decrypt it), but please do not use it for any sensitive information encryption as it sucx... 

No libraries required. 
Just ensure you have a Python 3.7 or later interpreter. 
Enter the text you want to encrypt and it will output the gibberish text. 
To decrypt it, use the decrypter to decrypt.
