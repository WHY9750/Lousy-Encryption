# Simple_Encryption

This program takes ASCII characters and convert to their ASCII index and then make some multiplication, division and summation and then do a couple a swaps in the index location and then eventually give us a very gibberish text. I written this code in a day without any background or any referenecing to anyone and I most certainly have no idea what is cryptography at the time of writing this code. That is why it is a very lousy encryption (I dont't know, not an expert to judge :p), so please do not use it for any sensitive information encryption... 

No libraries required. 
Just ensure you have a Python 3.7 or later interpreter. 
Enter the text you want to encrypt and it will output the gibberish text. 
To decrypt it, use the decrypter to decrypt.
