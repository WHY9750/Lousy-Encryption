# Lousy_Encryption

This program is written within a day. Thus there will be some issues...

Problems that might occur tentatively
- If the text you are encrypting is too long, then the integer overflow issue may occur... Leading to all sorts of other problem...

No libraries required. 
Just ensure you have a Python 3.7 or later interpreter. 
Enter the text you want to encrypt and it will output the gibberish text. 
To decrypt it, use the decrypter to decrypt.
